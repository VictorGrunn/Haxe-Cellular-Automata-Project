Haxe-Cellular-Automata-Project
==============================
/**

 * 
 * The unimaginatively named TestGroup comprises the heart of this project.
 * This was posed as a programming challenge on Reddit, where users were invited
 * to create an environmental simulation/cellular automata following a 
 * variety of simple rules.
 * 
 * The grid should contain 50% trees, 10% Lumberjacks, and 2% bears.
 * Every 'turn' should comprise a month.
 * Each 'month', bears should move 5 random spaces. Lumberjacks, 3.
 * If a lumberjack encountered a tree, it should be cut down and 1 wood should be gained.
 * If a lumberjack encountered an elder tree, it should be cut down and 2 wood should be gained.
 * If a lumberjack encountered a bear, the lumberjack should be removed.
 * 
 * At the end of each year, if wood gathered exceeded total lumberjacks, additional lumberjacks should be added.
 * If a lumberjack was eaten, remove 1 bear from the forest.
 * 
 * Initially the game was supposed to end at either the elimination of all trees or a certain year. I have removed the
 * year requirement for the purposes of this demonstration.
 * 
 * A caveat: This game makes use of HaxeFlixel 3.5. HaxeFlixel has since been updated to 4.0, breaking some compatibility.
 * But the original swf and code and 3.5 still represents the project as it was created.
